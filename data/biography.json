      "summary": "As a passionate full-stack engineer, I specialize in exploring cutting-edge technologies and applying them to practical applications. My core philosophy is 'learning through application' — whenever I encounter new technologies, I actively seek practical implementation opportunities to understand their strengths and limitations, building a comprehensive technical evaluation framework for optimal technology selection in future projects.\n\nThroughout my career progression, I've recognized that exceptional engineers should not be confined to purely technical domains but must possess cross-disciplinary integration capabilities. Therefore, I continuously expand my knowledge boundaries, from business analysis and user experience to project management and even accounting, enabling me to design solutions that better meet actual requirements through these diverse perspectives.\n\nIn the wave of the AI revolution, I actively embrace the changes brought by AI and redefine my working paradigm. From initially using AI to assist with development challenges, to implementing GitHub Copilot for AI-collaborative development, and now utilizing Cursor for intelligent programming, I've gradually positioned myself as a 'system architect' — focusing on overall planning, architectural design, and technical decision-making while letting AI handle tedious code implementation, achieving higher-level value creation and making engineers more than just engineers."
